Clean the data
1. Clean the date completed
```{r}
#setwd("~/Desktop")
library(prettyR)
setwd("C:/Users/Matthew.Hanauer/Desktop/Diss")
data_needs = read.csv("CRINeedsAssessment_DATA_2020-10-12_0959.csv", header  = TRUE)
### Remove me, Taylor, Nathan, Jennifer, Bre, and Joan before we count for percentage complete
data_needs$keep = ifelse(data_needs$name == "Matt", 0, ifelse(data_needs$email == "Bre.Banks@centerstone.org", 0, ifelse(data_needs$email == "Joan.Sykora@centerstone.org", 0, ifelse(data_needs$email == "Nathan.Nehrt@centerstone.org", 0, ifelse(data_needs$email == "Taylor.Moore@centerstone.org", 0, ifelse(data_needs$email == "Jennifer.Lockman@centerstone.org", 0, 1))))))
data_needs = subset(data_needs, keep == 1)
data_needs$keep = NULL
# check it worked
sum(data_needs$email == "Bre.Banks@centerstone.org")
dat_needs = data_needs
library(lubridate)
head(dat_needs)
# Only include those who consented
dat_needs = subset(dat_needs, consent_yes_no == "1")
# Only include those completed the survey
dat_needs = subset(dat_needs, needs_assessment_timestamp != "[not completed]")
write.csv(dat_needs, "dat_needs.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
Get the percentage of people who completed the survey and n
```{r}
n_total = dim(data_needs)[1]
n_complete = dim(dat_needs)[1]
percent_complete = round(n_complete / n_total, 2)
n_results = cbind(n_total, n_complete, percent_complete)
n_results

```

Get a count and percentage of pss 
0 is first then 1
