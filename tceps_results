Now link the two for testing for missingness
Need to link with post TCEPS scores as well
Need to keep all the original consented folks and what we can from the pre and post testing
```{r}

tceps_demos_pre_post = merge(tceps_demos_pre, post_tceps_mkeps, by = "record_id", all.x = TRUE)

TestMCARNormality(tceps_demos_pre[-c(1)])

```
Get pre and post testing matched results
Get post and demos for participant characteristics
```{r}
pre_post_tecps = merge(pre_tceps_mkeps, post_tceps_mkeps, all.y =  TRUE)

N's for flow
